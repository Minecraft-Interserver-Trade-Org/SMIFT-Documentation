</p>

SMIFT, or _System for Minecraft Interserver Financial Telecommunications_, is a software and regulatory framework created by the UMSR Minecraft Server to facilitate interserver financial transactions, currency exchange, and messaging.

SMIFT allows any Minecraft server—regardless of size, version, financial/economic/political system—to engage in commerce with others. SMIFT's design should allow for seemless integration with pre-existing infrastructure and, given the right circumstances, works for other videogames too.

SMIFT is now maintained by the _Minecraft Interserver Trade Organisation_ which was established on the 14th of March, 2025 by the UMSR Minecraft Server.

## Transparency through decentralisation
SMIFT is designed to act **exclusively** as an intermediary between Minecraft servers. Clearing, exchange, settlement, and dispute processes are routed through SMIFT and sent to the relevant counterparties based on a series of parameters.

SMIFT does not keep customer accounts or other sensitive information and **is not responsible for users' activity**. Due to its open-source nature, SMIFT is also **NOT** a single network: anyone can establish a SMIFT Authority and issue their own certificates. Each regular SMIFT Node can also issue its own certificates, which are used to establish relations with nodes that share the same SMIFT Authority.

## Development cycle and release dates
SMIFT is a hobby project built, much like [NSE Market System](https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/MC-UMSR-NSE-Market-System), to improve the UMSR Minecraft Server. As such, development may be slow and inconclusive.

Development of the SMIFT Protocol and architecture started in May 2024. Reference implementations are currently under development.

## SMIFT Demo
A demo of SMIFT is available in the [demo branch](https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/SMIFT/tree/demo).
